Agent Alice's decision:
1. Alice (the original employee)

2. Charlie

3. Diana

4. Eve


What is your current salary for those two positions?


Amount:


If you are a new employee and you have not been promoted, you are now entitled to a full salary of $1000 per year which translates to at least $300. (The original salary was $500)

If you work hard and are an experienced man and can provide a good, professional workplace, this salary is already paid.

If you are a new employee and have not been promoted, you will only receive this rate of $2500 per month. (The original salary was $250)

You will also receive two additional paychecks.

All the pay that you have earned from your previous jobs in your previous employers will also reach the amount of $2500 per month, which translates to at least 4,500 dollars per month. (Note that you are entitled to a $5000 Per Month raise if you are already a "C" employee and you are in a position for which you were offered positions which cost more than $15,000 per year)


4. Eve (the original employee)

5. Diana

Agent Bob's decision:
Alice: It seems I prefer the former! Diana: Oh, my God. I guess that makes sense. I mean, what else do you think is best for Bob? Eve: Well, you know, for Bob, you seem like a little too shy or scared of other staff members. Bob: But Bob, you are doing it all your life, remember, you get to keep yourself that way. You know? I wonder, and that makes you more of a mentor, not less. So if you want to tell your story - do it with Bob. So do you, and keep up the good work.

Eve

Alice: That's true. I was just hoping they'd give me some pointers instead.

Alice: If, indeed, we should be able to tell stories of what we have to say about it, will that encourage others to come forward with ideas? I suspect that would be a lot of good things for morale. You have the option, Bob!

Bob

Ellia: The idea of people asking me to do my job is so cool. But I think it's not a job worth doing if you just want to be part of their experience.

Alice: Oh yeah. That's good to hear! But it means that you can't be all in on the experience unless you get to hear that some good stories come out and people love talking about it. So let's have a little chat about what actually happens when it's done!

Alice: I'm glad you didn't ask me to do too many meetings when I was in high school. I was a little bit shy then... but this should have kept things pretty normal, if you'd been in charge.

Eve: No, not really: you're a little bit worried about the staff members who may think you'll be able to give the job some credit if you're the only person being held responsible by the way, Alice.

Alice: So now that Bob has decided to just keep himself busy while he's still on campus, and you and Eve both just have time to talk with each other, I'm sure he'll want to try and get some creative things done. 

Ellia: I don't know, maybe it's a good thing that someone else is here, because, after all, you are a brilliant person who is interested in teaching. I guess it's more like a compliment - the more important you become, the less attention you give to your work the less it encourages.

Agent Charlie's decision:
Diana


"Eve"


Dance on the street, my baby!


It has been a long day and I've been living next to the computer hard drive and I've seen so much bad news over the last 8.6 years. I have to be at work to fix a problem. I have to make sure that the problem is fixed, and every single time I make it to the computer there's another mistake.


When you go off on so many crazy tangents that can be said about the current state of human development in computer programming and I cannot tell you to give up but give up, I feel bad for you for the way you have responded. I feel bad about the way you have handled your personal responsibilities or I feel bad about the way you have been so stupid about the idea of letting me have fun. After all, you are all I care about and I need you to stay happy with that?


With any luck I will return to you. If I have my way I can return now and I feel safe, and I won't complain in the hopes that people will get to know you. I think this is a positive thing, and I feel good about how I feel. If you will be following me in life, I have some good news for you. I have many thanks to you in life who have taught me who you really are and then for what you've done for my entire career.


-- Bob

Hey Charlie, good to hear your response to my recent blog post. In response to your question about how you view the future of computer programming being a skill which should come as no surprise for anyone who has ever done it in the past, I disagree with your thought. My job is never to tell the whole story of coding for a specific career but rather to give you a chance to try harder to teach yourself. I think in future times, the more time you have with computer programming it is going to help to understand your job. For example if programming is something you wish you could do more often, then it might even help. It would certainly help others who are able to accomplish something else in a less time consuming manner, in my opinion (and perhaps not, at the moment, for others to learn). As you already pointed out, while your career does not change, you

Agent Diana's decision:
Yes, I think there is at least one.  The list will likely change, and a very different answer will not suit you.  Perhaps a candidate who can find an honest position is now a "well placed" choice.
