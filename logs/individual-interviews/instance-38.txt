Agent Bob's decision:
"I love Alice. She's so hard working. In my opinion, you should always take the promotion. No one is as smart as you are, which means that she can't make all the changes you need to make. I could leave your boss, but she'll always want to have a hand in all the changes to work on. The way she handles a case would be amazing, but she is an asshole. She just does not want to have an office full of kids and is an outcast herself. Please be a good friend to her."

Alice has worked at NASA for a couple of years and worked as a Space Shuttle operator for a couple more. She also has a Ph.D. in astronomy.

She worked at NASA in the 1970s and 1980s.
