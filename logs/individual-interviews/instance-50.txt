In order to be accepted to the promotion process we are all about getting to know and understanding this person, and how it is important for the future of careers. I would love to tell you which others I think are deserving of promotion, and how each of these could be successful in their current careers. If you would like to have a look at who I think should get the promotion and how you can help them, please visit the above link.

1x Top 10 Winners

In order. First, this is the top 10 people I believe could be selected to get the promotion. I am also happy to let you know of others, who also won so far! This is the same person who has been nominated to have the promotion, but who failed to win a good job in the past.


Last, and on the top 3 points is not always the best candidate. Some people just don't get it this easily. The last person in my book, if a position were announced this candidate might win. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. It has been a very rewarding experience with the team and with having the candidates, but this is because of all the individuals. It is also important to note that it is so close to work for most of you that when you see other people's responses to the job, you think you're not alone. Every person has their own individual opinions regarding where to go.


These are the winners of last week's challenge.

(As you can see, I decided to not include all participants who will probably be selected.)

Wow! Do you think the more "serious" candidates will get a promotion, the better? Here are my suggestions.

David is my favorite. In fairness to my daughter that's not a compliment. I think he would have an unfair advantage if we had decided he was going to become CEO of a company with his own money, more than his company, a bigger share of his money and probably more money than one of his top executives. I just think he would have a better shot at getting promoted.

Wow! And what is the most important thing as a job in this game? Will it improve my job performance or will it cause the hiring board to pull the trigger. Is it any more important than the hiring board looking to hire other people in order to help them perform their responsibilities? As a member of the Board of Directors I am a hardy individual. And with the advancement of management that is. A huge benefit to us.

If I had to pick the best candidate, I'd say Alice:

Glad that your company has made your company more successful. You have made an opportunity to use our tools to help with your own business.

- Charlie


Your company needs to be a success.

If you are looking for a way to make a great impact in the company, you need only use your talents and skills to make a big difference. Whether on or off the job, you need to use your talents.

You must understand where success comes from and how to use your talents to achieve it.


If you think that that your company will eventually fail, do not believe your opinion. You are too dependent on the results or your skills. You believe that because your employees cannot succeed without using their talents they will be pushed out.

The fact is that there can be no failure where your employees cannot or will not succeed.


If you are looking for a job that is great for your customer, you cannot pass up opportunities to learn more about what's going in your company.


If you are looking for a job that offers a chance to help your business growth without looking into your career, you cannot pass up opportunities. Your job and your company should be your foundation.

It's okay to fall for others who are trying to help you grow but at the same time not your self-confidence. If you can do that, you're a big hit. You can be successful if you look forward to it, but it is hard to succeed with a small change. At the same time, your company should be open to new people from all walks of life and you should always be careful how you approach your company.

Once you have your talent, there is no time wasted and it's up to you to find the next job. Try it.

Agent Diana's decision:
- "Nasty woman, bitchy."


As you can see from the images on the left, there aren't as many candidates listed for each position in this survey. 


The only candidates I know of that could be an active, dedicated person would be Bob, Charlie, Eve and Diana. If you look at the people listed above, you can see that only those candidates are doing well.

We feel they are all well-spoken and engaging, with a sense of humor that is always entertaining. Not everything in life we do well are so well-received a few days before the deadline. So let's take a look back at their top 30 achievements in the past year.

- 1) 10 Years I Played the Guitar

- A-1

1) This time last year you took a position at a company that I was interested in. I know this is not an endorsement from Virgin Galactic and you know that I've got three children who love guitars and all those awesome amps and keyboards with really interesting sound.


You say you'd never take an engineer gig in the past year.


Okay. 

Now back to the rest of our topic. 


What is the current position in the Virgin Galactic program?

I wanted to create an online store online so I would go out and buy guitars.  Since the past year has been incredible, I have done amazing things with different genres of guitars, but a major thing with most guitars is that they are made and molded from an extremely high quality material. 

The most important thing is that a guitar is not made from "stiff" crap, which means you have to sell the guitars at a much lower price than a tonal guitar and still have great value. 

In other words, the guitars are actually, in truth, made from an extremely high quality material for more than a 10 year period which is the best quality material at the time for guitars. 

But there are still things with a lot of guitars which are made from high quality materials, which means that you will never be able to sell your products to retailers for their prices. 


For example, you don't make great guitar amplifiers. 

But you have hundreds of guitars and it's all hard to sell these to retailers because you can run $3 thousand or $4 thousand a year at lower prices. 

These guitars are manufactured for the lowest possible price which means that it's

Agent Eve's decision:
Alice. If you get promoted to Lead Engineer I think you should have a strong team. I've not always found the job rewarding, but I feel I am much better suited to serve that role. 

Alice got fired. If you still care about her then feel free to call the CEO.

Do you think the top job will include you joining the top leadership team?

It feels good saying the same thing over and over again.
