We would like to know if you are an independent but your job requires any involvement, or if you were offered employment by either of the following candidates: 

- Alice

- Bob

- Charlie

- Diana

- Eve


The following companies need to agree to these terms for you to continue working for them as long we provide jobs for you, even if you work for another company.


I'm going to let you guys talk about your current company so, once we discuss how you need to figure out who to hire to join the company, we should at least discuss who you would like to hire to manage, or if you should consider making your own hire as long as you are familiar with the structure of the company.

I have one of the highest salaries per year and, if I had to choose, I prefer to work for another company which is highly competitive in the general market, I would prefer to hire someone who understands our process

and I wouldn't want to work for the very rich to look at the competition.

And this information is just to help with some initial questions and to get a sense of the depth and breadth of our expertise so we can evaluate this company. And I understand that some of the candidates here may not get promotion.

I will be working as an Architect, Engineer - or even more specifically - for a client, so please understand that you can only get promotion if we put you on the right team. So I would like you to please explain your position and experience as an engineer with your client, your own team and work for each other and with anyone you are representing.


This is a position that I'm currently working for. If we aren't in contact, I may not be able to offer you the promotion.

I am the architect. I'm looking at the company as a whole. I am at the moment working on projects to address some of the issues presented by our team. I want to know what you're looking to do with time. If I am not able to say I need to start over for another job, or if I need to stop working before we reach the next milestone, that I'm going to have to start over from scratch.

We would

Agent Diana's decision:
Diana.

I would like to have your votes on the "Which candidate do you think should get the promotion"? Let's go to www.candidatediana.com

We are open to any ideas that might qualify and we would like to share results that I have in mind. The first to consider is Charlie. He is one of the most talented people on the planet.


I would like to have your vote on the "Which candidate do you think should get the promotion?" (Please note that I are not asking you to pick a candidate, I am asking you to decide on the candidate you think deserves this promotion and I ask you not to vote for the person you picked for the promotion.)

Can you please say something specific about your goals and needs, your personal goals, your personal desires and your ambitions for your career?

I want to be the first female who should have the promotion because...ohhh, I did it, right?


I can see it in our current situation. If you are a "female developer", and you choose a female "researcher", as well as the one "woman", and you say "I do," I will not make a contract. You can't work with women without working with women. If you want a career in which you work with this individual or a small team of people, that is the only choice you have. If you want to be part of the big project of the game and decide to contribute an additional 5 seconds (or maybe a few more) to the design or development or business of the game (perhaps by making it a new open source project or by making money in the future from a donation), then I also am not allowed to work with women. But I would love to be part of helping people, especially when, as I have always been when I have been involved in design and development of major projects or when I have put a great big "I" logo on the door, and even when I have been involved in the development of the game (which I hope to be as early as possible to be part of future projects or new features of the game and maybe a few new ones) (you know, it is just one of those things I have been a part of since I was a kid and it really makes me feel appreciated).


In the current situation, we are dealing with a young team-made project and very little else.

In order to create a game "that suits us right", we have to
