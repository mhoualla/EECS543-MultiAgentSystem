Agent Bob's decision:
Bob: Your team is better than this. If you are the man. I am sure you are right on it, but there are four men you can choose from. They are not being a bit too generous here. I think if all four of us want to please our leader then we are able to get some sort of promotion. But if we want to get promoted to this position we have another option - we cannot just be 'a man'. We cannot only be an 'A'. We must all be a better team together. So to start from Alice and then bring Bob in again.

Bob: If everyone who votes for you is female, that is your job well done. All members of your team are welcome.

Your answer:

Ellen: Yeah, I am not sure that this is true. I was just wondering if you could explain why she said this (you didn't pick her on the list for her job). I am not sure if this is because you wanted to know why she said this.

Ellen: Well I am a female. My dad made it obvious that he was going to have a relationship with one of the guys here.

Ellen: And he got a job in the next two months. He has a lovely wife, who will make him happy and he is a great man - she looks after him - so she has always been very nice to me. What I have read is that she wants to be the next mayor of the city and I am happy to be here for that, too, you know. She wants to be able to take care of all their needs when she needs them most. And if she could decide what needs we all would all be happy and happy that we are not being 'a man'.

Charlie: So, how did you get into politics?

Charlie: I worked in business for two years. And I have known David for 40 years and his company was a success and became one of the most successful in the UK.

Ellen: And when it came to politics that I know you wanted, you were very, very lucky to get elected. What is your experience of it? I guess I have a few interesting stories there.

Ellen: I'm a very good at reading a lot of newspapers because I have learned some things very quickly. There are people in this town who would rather just hear things from'real people'. The first I found out was the fact that there was one man in
------------------------------------------------------------

Agent Charlie's decision:
"You guys are not in a position to make those things happen."

And if the position didn't suit them, you won't agree with them on this, but you can't deny it's your choice after all.
------------------------------------------------------------

Agent Diana's decision:
My job is to tell you who should get promoted. This was what I did last time around: "I'm an idiot but I'm here to do that job and I'm willing to help, not a job creator."

I'm a male and I was already doing good so I didn't mind because I was able to learn from both. Do not give up on your female, male, or other candidates. I want to show that when a person is good at something, the best thing is to let it go.

You should leave all comments about your female work and the choice you make in a general way. You should make sure everyone has the same idea: I only care about what the other person's thought process is.

You should not put any negative comments on your team saying they can't make you look good, that they will go into your job and that you should get a promotion.

Don't ask anyone to play by your script. The only advice you have is that if someone needs their "fear of failure" said before, they get it right. You are the leader and have all the power at your disposal. And because nothing will happen and you are confident you have your head in front of you, that you will stand your ground as good of a leader.


To your first request.

What we will do:


- Have a team member write your response and tell him why you are making good decisions. Make sure not to share your reasoning or make accusations.


- Ask the person who created the team what you think the issue is. Don't be afraid to break my time-tested team time rules

In case you ask, "Oh, my friend, I really need people like you," please put in the above comments (just don't try to be rude when discussing the person) and be polite. I promise that you will always know better.


I think we can all agree that your ideas were not well thought out. People are not stupid. They are going to try everything they can to find solutions. If it proves that the problem is not really your team's fault, then you can assume the situation won't last forever unless that makes you better. You are not going to have a great season.


- Be more open about your idea.

In my business I am responsible for my employees lives. It is my responsibility to build relationships with the community I manage. I will never compromise in my business and I

Agent Eve's decision:
I have had some time to really listen to everyone who's been through this match up and see what they think and what they're passionate about. Let me give you my take:

- I've done my bit to get them to support this change. I want more of them to support the change I'm trying to reach - what's it like?

- They look forward when I do it. I know they'll enjoy this new thing. I really hope that people like me won't give up so early, because everyone else has made a great contribution.

- They won't let their friends or family down. This is for them and is about what they deserve as much as possible, and you have to do your part.

- Even though I personally don't like you, I understand what you're thinking. I'm going to stick with you, but I'd like as many of you to be the ones to make this happen, and you're going to find a way.

- You think that this is just as easy to do as this is for others, and the only way to do this as well is to help.

- You said I've been to many matches that weren't on me. Would you be willing to help me get it right in a match up? Do you know something about this club? Is it right in your heart to help, or will you change course and help myself if you can somehow make this happen?

- I have played at my club of 17 years and we've been in the same league for over 20 years.

- We've competed at both the Junior and Senior levels. Since we go through this, when we're playing for clubs outside our home country, we've played at my home club at home.

- We've played for a few different organizations here in America - one of which was the U.K. - and one of which was the U.S. team here. This has just been a huge challenge for our team and this has been a tremendous thing for them. We've had teams that are able to handle them very well...

- As we look at the club's schedule now, we're looking at how our league system plays. As you all know we've been playing in the United States and New York, which is the American league for years now, and they're winning titles at every level. We've played in that league many times. We've gone through different challenges here in America
