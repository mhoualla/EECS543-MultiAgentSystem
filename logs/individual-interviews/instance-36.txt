Agent Alice's decision:
1) I am not aware of any candidate from Alice at some point in their career. As of today, no candidate from Alice has ever made the cut to be promoted. 

2) You will have to go find a job for you. I find that the chances of finding a job in this field are very slim given these statistics.

3) There is a chance you will only be in a senior position for one month at the end of the term. If the chances are lower then this will be a great way to start your career.

7) I am the best that I'm ever got.

3) the person was promoted by the team the programmer works for. I have no idea if the team is really great. However, they are the best in the team.


Answer

1) I believe those two things.

2) you are totally capable of doing this job.

3) you know better then to dismiss yourself and you will never get a job.

4) I don't know of any other job that would suit someone just so this job could be offered.


Answer

1) I have no clue.

2) I trust people well enough, do I trust somebody? 

3) when you say that the person can do this jobs, it is extremely simple. 

4) when you say that if you work for someone for the next 12 months, you won't get promoted.

One of the first Bitcoin exchanges. Mike was a top developer of the popular Bitcoin wallet for financial institutions.

His goal was to build a platform to let users do Bitcoin trades from anywhere.


My plan today is to release a new feature for MtGox, called the "Bit Exchange" so that when you buy bitcoins on MtGox you can exchange BTC or a smaller value.


I expect to make it clear this feature will get a lot more coverage if I make it available to anyone.

Agent Diana's decision:
Yes. 

You see, you need to choose one of the following :

- Alice

- Bob

- Charlie

- Diana

- Eve

Which candidates do you think are worth taking a look at most currently?

Why should you even bother?

Also, some other potential candidates.

But here we are at an inflection point; we don't want to be here before we get to you - that's why I will cover you! -

Diana's not getting promoted

I am still waiting for my job to open with me, so if you find out that you had to ask for it to happen, but it did happen and is currently closed (and a long waiting process could happen), then I'll write the rest of this post and make it available until next week or so (please call my Customer Care or call (360) 633-5555 if it's not already filled in).

The hiring deadline

If you don't think you are suitable for your position, then you should just consider going outside the organization - it could have an impact on your earnings at the end of the month or at the beginning of the year if you didn't have all the relevant benefits of a decent employee salary. 

If you don't want to wait, then consider applying now - I personally don't mind that because (1) I don't really care whether you want to remain at the company I'm in and (2) getting promoted to new positions is definitely an extremely rewarding experience! 

This job is free. Thank you.

P.S. I don't accept credit for the amount of work the hiring manager spent (at the end of October).

How it works

The job is the same as any other - you need to know you can be promoted, and you can apply for promotions at any stage of life.

The positions are open to all new employees. If you see one still available, you can start applying now!

If your job title is not clear yet, please read this article.
