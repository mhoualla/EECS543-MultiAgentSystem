Agent Bob's decision:
Bob, you think this was a bad idea. We actually don't know for sure but from what I have been able to discern, this seems like a bad decision. What makes this process so difficult is to decide who to hire. You have this very difficult decision every single day. You are a talented person and have the skills to make this decision. There are others out there who, in their mind, had better use this opportunity. What it actually costs is at least some money and I'm honestly sure this process is too costly for you to be able to make it in a day.


But let's be real: I have never actually had my chance to talk to people and I do believe that many have felt strongly about whether to hire you. It is very difficult to know what the right person is to make such this complicated decision and the decisions that you need to have. As you are probably aware of the vast majority of job postings in the world all the time the majority of the people who are interested in finding someone really enjoy their job and even for once they don't want to do this job for a profit. At this point you can still decide when your chance of getting this job ends. That only changes if you are a successful businessman.


As for all the other people who are not interested in the job position I would not recommend this to anybody and it has no effect on the job search at all. Most people will go for the job. Many people don't consider things to be "important" or they take a chance and work in an area where things are not really important or they have other reasons to avoid the job altogether. For me it does have its impact on me. Every day that I'm working for you has a negative influence on my decision on the job. It creates a feeling of hopelessness that my choices are wrong and these decisions lead to a depression, anxiety, fear of getting laid, having to cut a break with my family and friends, and so on.


Now let's say I get nominated for a job on our front end and a very talented woman comes across and she says she needs a consultant, she is interested in this gig, she wants to interview me, and so I say, "Well, I want to see if I can do this. It makes it easier and I want to find the person that I can talk to before I go on that interview phase. If it makes sense to me, as for yourself and the company that I work for, then how about we do this and help you figure out what's going on?"

Agent Craig's decision:
In the end I won't say who has the fastest and most promising idea on this list.  If I could you would recommend one that I think deserves a mention. It's my favorite idea from the day I took my new position, to put it nicely. That one was my favorite, probably and probably will be my next big project.
