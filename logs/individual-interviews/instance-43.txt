Eve is the most interesting, funny, intelligent woman I have met in my life. Her intellect is beautiful, and is so funny, because she does so much at once. __________________

To some people, Eve is like a big-time movie star. __________________

I don't want to become the new Disney Princess or anything, but Eve did all the hard work you guys need to be a part of. __________________

Eve was the first woman not to have an affair, until I said "Yes" as soon as I met you. I really hope that you will be the next man I know.

The promotion of Eve is really simple:

I want to see you get promoted if you decide to go up to your next job or if you leave in your current position. __________________

This whole process you said is really easy. No problem. __________________

No pressure to say "No" to me until one of you comes in. __________________

No problem. __________________

I want to be a successful entrepreneur, Eve. __________________

But in my heart, I couldn't help asking. __________________

In the end, for me, this job doesn't matter. __________________

I'm thinking about you. __________________

I'm really really impressed: you are my dream job candidate. __________________

I never thought my dream would happen.
