Agent Bob's decision:
- Bob


I love my job (and I don't think I will ever hire anyone who isn't from China). It's one of the great advantages to being a computer programmer in China. And I'm also quite happy with all my job opportunities. But I'm not sure why I'm starting here. Let me explain that I'm currently looking to hire a senior engineer from Canada (or Canada for you) for my Senior project team (see: http://www.microsoft.com/developer/app-reviews/) in my company. 

My new job position (in the last week of my old contract) is to be a technical researcher in an academic institution. From time to time (except in emergencies) the university department will have a full-time specialist (a consultant, or more) available that brings about a technical breakthrough.  Since most senior project projects are now at the bottom of the pile and the professor and his colleagues feel strongly about their ability to work on them, I want not only an academic job, but an experience from which I could earn a decent living and improve their livelihood. And that is why I'm looking to work with the Canadian university department. 

But I'm not sure if it's a matter of if he or she will get the job, or if he will be able to get a promotion. I'm curious, so I'm posting about this on the back of this blog. 


As I know a lot of you don't want me doing my work if I'm not with you. I wouldn't be very happy if anyone else was doing it, because I am quite passionate about it myself. But for some people it is simply not something they would want done. 


For me, as a computer science student, there are some really large projects I want to do. One is the development of software. A good example would be the development of the SSE software for the SLS. 

In terms of my new job, I'm more interested in my technical studies than teaching/research. I find this a great experience because it allows me to focus on my research rather than simply teaching the students, but I also can start making time for the kids who, as a scientist, have a lot more interest in science and education than most of my colleagues. It's a useful part of my future. 


Thanks,


Chris C.

Do you have an idea for a promotion? What can I offer you if you get 2 or more!


A promotion would be one without the above mentioned perks. For example, if you get 2-5 awards, and have worked for 10 companies, you will not get any bonus.


Thank you!

I am thinking of giving you a promotion to work for 2,300 companies in a single company. I am thinking of giving you a pay rise. What are the options for you?


I would be happy to have you work for a minimum of 5 jobs before reaching you. After that, it is your turn to work for the remaining 5. So far I have given you 5% more.

Bob (from "C"/"Z"/"Z")


If you want to work for more companies you can work the whole year or one month at a time. This way you have the maximum compensation you can give.


We need a plan to get you started. That means we need money - and we need other skills we don't have to work. If we can't get us the same way we need, we can always work for other employers. Also, if we have a plan, that would keep us from setting back on our course.

What will this offer cost you?


Well it will allow you to choose between:


* 5 jobs


* 2 jobs (depending on the length of the contract) I will make a choice of work for you. You choose to work for 2 companies, 3 job's, etc. I will make sure that you have to meet all the different conditions before I have the 3 jobs offer. But you can choose to go with 1, or 2.


What job would you like to work for, if I am in a position where the number of paid positions is only 1?

Agent Eve's decision:
Alice, Bob, Charlie and Diana. That could be you.


I can't see where this should go, either, because I didn't take an active part in the last election. At the moment, it seems like I have my first choice.


Please feel free to contact me if you would like to suggest someone to get this promotion. The most possible candidates who would benefit from it are Alice, Alice, Bob, Alice, Charlie and myself. For those who do not want a promotion, please take this message in confidence.


Thank you for your consideration.
