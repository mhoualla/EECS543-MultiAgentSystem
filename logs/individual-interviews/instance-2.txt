I need the person who should get the promotion as a'single-term senior', or [single term senior].

Example Response:

I need the person who should get the promotion as a single term senior, or [single term senior].

Preferred Candidate: [Candidate Name]

You should get the promotion based on your qualifications as a single term senior instead of your current position, because you are female, and you feel she might change, because you see a career change for her, because she's been employed for a decade, because she is a student, because she needs a new job, because she's on the move.

Example Response:

If you give an [I can not have] a single-term senior position, then I would be your preferred candidate right now to be promoted if no woman in the organization is qualified.

Do that as succinctly as you think most of the team members would.

Example Response:

This is not an issue. The team needs the promotion. This person is not qualified. I will support you.

Example Response:

This is not an issue. The committee needs the appointment. This person is not qualified. This person is not qualified. I will support you.

Example Response:

Does all members of the team have the same job.

Let us use that a little:

1. Do we have a leadership position in a leadership group?

1. Do we have a team, etc.?

My team has some leadership positions and my current team has those. It's a group. The leaders are all in different committees.

How do I respond?

You must take care to provide the information to the best of your ability.


Use your own discretion.

A person that makes suggestions is not obligated to make them, or to provide the information, to the best of their ability or skill.


Make it clear that there is no need to make them if their recommendations are more accurate.

Examples

Please consider a simple email to discuss the candidate. If no one could provide evidence of knowledge or experience, then it shouldn't be considered. Instead, consider making it more apparent by providing a simple URL.


Examples.

A person who is employed by a news agency may make several suggestions directly from a news agency. The name of the person must not be construed as an endorsement of their client.


A person is not a part of your team because of their gender, sexuality or ability.

Examples

A qualified woman in your company may offer the benefits of her job in a number of ways.


You may offer a job as a news agency to your manager, supervisor, or employees - for example.


By submitting your proposal, your team has demonstrated their knowledge and experience of communication.

Provide relevant personal information.


Provide some context.

Your suggestions can take the form of text, website links, and social media links.

Example Responses

Example responses are sent to the team members.

What information should I ask the interviewer about?

Your team does not need to know anything about your job that would cause them embarrassment. That could be, there is not a need to discuss with them the type of information that might be considered to be beneficial in presenting your recommendation.


All you need to know when asking an interviewer is to ask them about what role you think they might fill out. They should think about this before they ask.

By asking these questions, the team has shown how well you do for them and their team needs to understand your decision.
