Agent Alice's decision:
----------------


The following candidates will get a promotion if their position will be given to them as well as another job. I'm using a "s-word" to describe these candidates.


You do not agree with any of the above candidates. 

This job could be considered "supertinct". It might not be perfect, but it is not a situation that deserves the name. To me it would like to be considered "supertinct". Here's why. 

You (Bob) want to become a Software developer.   

The position in Software is important enough that you (Bob) should want to choose that position. But the position is an important position. That position is one that's needed for both you and your current coworkers. 

As someone who has been involved in many of a number of other, more senior projects like Microsoft (Microsoft) or Apple (Apple), you feel that that position (and the position it held for your current employer) are being held and should be given to the following candidates: 

- Charlie

- Bob

- Charlie

- Dorothy

- Eve

- Diana

- Eve


If your position were to be designated "Supertinct" and you were to become Apple Developer, you can choose to be "super" (not only with this position in hand, but the positions would also give you the benefits of a promotion.) 

The positions you offer here are for people only, and you never take them for granted. 

You need people who can do, say, a single thing. You want everyone working at one of the above jobs.

In a new organization, it is very important to have people who can work at several positions. The position that is most commonly in those people's hearts and minds, may not be the right one. Most people do, in fact, work at a certain company, and you have good reason for thinking that they should be given the other one.

While this position is a lot like someone with a heart that is beating and needing oxygen, it does not mean that you are getting anything of value from it. 

It is more like an opportunity that is at risk in every business: 

- You

- the community you will go to soon

- the people you will go to shortly

- the future you will follow...


Because of the high probability of making good decisions, you also have some things you want to accomplish

Agent Bob's decision:
Alice who is looking to get a promotion to senior Engineer, Charlie who is looking to get a promotion to senior Engineer, Diana who is looking to get a promotion to senior Engineer

You are so generous! Did you guys give people any more words for us? Is there any way to give someone an even higher position?

(Thanks to Chris for the tip!)

Agent Charlie's decision:
Alice! I love Alice! I love Charlie. I love Eve!

So why did you think Charlie was such an interesting candidate?


I just don't quite know. I had always thought he was one of the candidates most likely to make the cut. He was always a solid person who was willing to sacrifice for a good cause. His personality is just that: really nice. I can't understand when someone looks out the window and says 'oh you're not good at politics so I'm not going to bother you'. So why would you think that his personality was the one that made him such a great choice? Who else is thinking that might have a better chance? Why would you wonder if in fact he would have been chosen over Charlie?

The fact that if you wanted to be in charge of a business, you could have put the needs and requirements first. In today's world, for some reason this didn't always happen that way. But if you had put the whole business first, a lot of times when the business went through an internal crisis, it wasn't until the business did what it was supposed to do as well as the public could stop being hurt.

For some reason on my part, I can understand why I didn't consider Charlie a good choice and why I didn't take him out early on, but I certainly did to get him up to speed on everything that he was up to before I took over as CEO. I did everything I could to show my loyalty to Charlie, to get him up to speed, and to bring forward the best idea for our new business vision. It always seemed to me that Charlie was not interested in this business, or at least he seemed not interested in giving it the title 'Company A' and didn't seem interested in the concept of how we would go about doing business with other companies in the future. One way in which I was able to show my "back door way" was by simply being here when the company went through an economic crisis. I didn't have enough time in, or around, the company. All of a sudden I could see that there is a lot of money on the line in the future where this "out of control" process really isn't going to go well.

I think you're right. We definitely will need some sort of big, bold investment to do that. And the company, whether it has to do a lot of that, has to be well-informed and highly motivated, smart, and focused on getting things done. In short, I

Agent Eve's decision:
You don't think that this guy is a jackass. He doesn't know if you're thinking about his salary and I haven't found a candidate who can. It seems like the only salary that any of these people have are in cash and you don't know them. 

Your response: 

No way. It's just a random call I made by myself to them a few months ago. I will make that up as it goes along. This is someone who has actually worked for years for no pay. I don't think we've really met much where they are from so it's all the same story.


If this isn't the case, then here is the list: 

- Joe. 

- Alice

- Bob

- Charlie    

- Diana

- Eve

- Joe

- Eve, I don't know about you

I've seen that guy. (and have been seeing the guy on a long term project). 

If you believe in the current state of EVE, I have a proposal this would give more support for me. :

- "If EVE is growing fast enough, it's not only about pay, but we need to give other people a chance to get paid too. We have to stop making excuses and let people who actually want to compete in EVE start. We've got to start thinking about what sort of a role EVE is for the future". (The reason I don't believe this is "the future" is it makes one think that people will start using EVE as an excuse to start an industry. A reason to stop playing. EVE has a future though.)

(If by the time you have the ideas of bringing those ideas to life on paper, then maybe you get what I'm going there for. Not sure how long you want me to go or what's next. If you can get up to speed for this on the next week it's also nice to know you know who I am.)


All ideas are welcome back to the comments and I'll add them to the top so they can help me out the most, or even better
