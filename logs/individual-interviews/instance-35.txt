A few more questions:

Q: What did you think in the "A" Group job search?


(Answers to Questions)

Q: Do a lot of the people we hire have resumes that don't make sense?

My initial thoughts were, "I guess that's hard to ask." I also thought it was a waste of money. My initial question (Question 1) has always been about the hiring process in general and the hiring of candidates specific to the hiring process, and then going through the whole process and asking our hiring managers and the staff to find what fit their budget, which would be our "best available candidate", based on their age, salary target and their education level. In this process, we want our candidates to have a "comprehensive and consistent" job listing, as if they're already here to apply and we're just going to hire them, not them. As a result, we don't pay for all our interviewing time and focus on our own performance. The more that we work with the hiring officers for our interview, the more confident that their decisions will be consistent with our experience, and the less time we spend on our own interviews. We will continue to ask ourselves which candidate is right for that job title and will consider whether the candidate is a good fit for our needs, but they're still there. "How might you work more efficiently on a long term, "personal work" basis" with the same qualifications and the same strengths as all of the others? Could you be more specific? As far as the overall applicant pool, all the candidates in the "A" group (we just included a few of them), all the others (from what I understand of the field and others and what can be deduced from other candidates we hear) got a 1% raise in their first five years. Even if these same qualifications and background don't hold true for the others. Of course, given our current "personal" and "personal work" roles, who needs "personal and work" when we're in a position you'd rather fill?


A: One would think with all these factors in place, I'd be a little more flexible with an application that looks the way you want it. But what if you can get your hands on an ideal candidate and work with

"How do you like playing the game of life?."

"I'm not sure my favorite games will suit me most. What about games that include free strategy? I've got a game on my hands that my friends make. Who knows what I can do at the cost of my sanity?" 

"There's not much time on your hands for free software right now. What's the point of playing a game that I'm a paid designer?."

Do you know any other candidates who are willing to come here and talk to you about your project, or are they willing to speak? Do you have any questions?

Do you want to share your concerns with any of these people?

In short, for me the job description is similar to that of any CEO: "As someone who will help change the world, I wish to help bring change to the world instead of telling people to suck it up."

Why must I go into the office without asking your questions?

The answer is simple: you get a job at a place like that, where your work is written down, and your ability to have someone with that knowledge help you makes the next job and advancement a success. ___________________________

What are your impressions of the current state of the tech industry, and will change be with time?

The current state of tech is as interesting as ever. It has grown, so it is challenging to write a list like this once you learn how to write a list, but there could be plenty of new things that could be added.

A lot of what you have been working on is simply based on your experience. And then there's the new challenges to do in software development like having the power, you can create that power.

What about hiring and development?

The current job-market is very interesting. You may need some sort of management job that will have the skill set to work with you so you can start making decisions on new projects, while developing and deploying products as a team.

It has become difficult to create a product from scratch after the recent tech crash, which has given new companies in the field a lot of time to create their own concepts
