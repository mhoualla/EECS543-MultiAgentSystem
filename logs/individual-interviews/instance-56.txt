Agent Alice's decision:
Bob.

Are you interested in moving to another area with a new job, or should you seek out another job in other places?

I've gone to the gym to work out and the thing I've been looking for a job every morning is bodybuilding. You have to do it. And I am always grateful when someone comes in with an idea and comes up with an idea as to why it could be beneficial in my new role at the same time as the previous one.

If somebody's on your team working as a Engineer for $50000, please feel free to give it a call. Any feedback is welcomed.

Agent Bob's decision:
Diana. I think that your wife is also the best candidate for the promotion. Do you have a question about Diana?

This position is held by me. Do you think Bob should still be employed to further the company and his career?


Yes. Why should I not have to work at that other company?


You are my future supervisor on your team of 20. I currently work for a $110 million company that makes up approximately 12% of the world's total GDP.


Bob and I have been friends since we were teenagers, which means we share the same interests. My interests are in business, technology, and entrepreneurship.


There are three jobs on here that you both enjoy. Do you consider yourself a "computer programmer"?


Yes. I currently have a BSc. I am responsible for the construction of every computer on the planet. I am responsible for the development of some large and large quantities of products, and have been designing programs for a while. I have worked on many small projects. I worked with various engineers, scientists (including myself I'd like to be recognized for working on that), and architects and engineers (including myself I'd like to be acknowledged as working on that).


Are you happy with the result so far?

Yes, very happy.


Have you ever wondered how Bob is like?


Well it is surprising what a positive one that can be to those not only friends, but even more personally.


I just gave you an interesting fact: when we were teens we lived in an apartment on the outskirts of Moscow. It is a typical day when we see Bob and I on the street, with our friends, laughing as we walk. After a while he takes our picture, and while the next day we all watch him walk, we all laugh. This morning we have become quite accustomed to his presence, and for me he is the biggest, and we laugh and laugh and laugh to each other.


On the morning that we had such a small wedding we bought a bottle and a few balloons, we watched him walk through the countryside. He was our friends. I have been a big fan of him and would never have thought he would move to the mountains without a name. The sky is beautiful. On the way back home he drove his car into a lake on a short drive and when we stopped at this place he called me a bit while we

Which candidate do you think should get the promotion? *


Alice? That's all I know of Alice. Please be as specific as I can that you have an interest in joining our team.


1- If I don't like it, don't apply. Don't tell me you liked it.


4 - I did not like it, but... it seemed pretty difficult to vote for. If it's difficult, I couldn't help you.


7 - I think I should have gone with one more person. I'm only 4yrs old. I'm in a bad place. Can you feel it? Did I leave you with an excuse to get away before I had an opportunity to work at SEGA?


15 - If I don't like it, don't apply. Don't tell me you liked it.


18 - I am at fault for what I did not like last summer... and then this summer. I think this Summer was like that... I did not like that. Is this so bad? Have you even considered going with him to the next three games or the next two?


22 - Could you explain why I have been thinking as long as I have, over what I can do with my life... I am in a terrible place and are looking up to someone at this office who knows all about me. So you could say... I do not belong in this office.


26 - Do you think I should have done something with my life to get involved in something bigger than this, I guess?


29 - You should have followed my advice with a donation to help fund your charity.


36 - I think I should have taken the time to read my letter to Alice

Agent Diana's decision:
I could hire these 3 people. 

You can't really think of a job title you're interested in doing better in. 

There is no need to be able to give a resume or qualifications, just do what you do best. 

As part of your job requirements, you must know several things about people who are interested in making a life. 

And this leads us to the key thing: you must know to make sure it won't offend. 

I'm a good candidate for those two. 

You're a nice kid and you know lots about math and a nice attitude.

In high school or college, I would be told how to make a lot of mistakes, so it will make you feel better.

However, I'm not sure I know how to get over the fear or the idea that the boss can take away my job and let the guy get away with that. 

It's a lot easier that way if you are willing to know a lot about what it takes to become a better engineer (and so less judgment). 

Because I've got great experience of writing long articles on engineering stuff and helping other people learn and grow.

When you've already worked with so many people, and you have a lot to learn from them, sometimes they can take a lot of work to be successful. So your resume and CV will definitely get a lot of attention. 

A lot of the time it won't.


You are currently learning how to write your own stuff, and you are very excited about doing it. 

It's been going on, and so far it shows. 

But please don't write your own stuff or write something that only one person can contribute. 

It only makes your life a lot better. 

You just don't get what everyone else has been saying. 

When I work for someone other than myself, I get this one thing, and then it kind of goes away

because I don't realize how much it is.

At first I think that I'm being nice, but after a while I realize this is a huge amount of work. 

I have lots of time on my hands, and I keep it up. 

So I do my best to avoid making mistakes and I keep my things up. 

This is really, really important to you. 

You need to stop asking for
