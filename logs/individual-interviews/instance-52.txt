Agent Alice's decision:
_____________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________


I only have a few ideas as to who will be promoted and how exactly would they all fare from here until the time the election comes? It has been a challenging process. I have not talked to an official person, and there is absolutely no way the decision is final...


I have done an interview and it is not official, but it is absolutely important to clarify the position, so this may result in their being nominated for promotion now, then eventually.


Thank you for your time and understanding.. _______________________________________________________I have done an interview and it is not official, but it is absolutely important to clarify the position, so this may result in their being nominated for promotion now, then eventually.Thank you for your time and understanding.

Thank you for reading,

Edit:

My question to both Bob and Charlie is why Alice's promotion is needed in the next election. You should understand the implications of her promotion in the next election, why it should be decided soon after the election, and what makes her a more valuable candidate. To the best of my knowledge, she had no prior experience. 

You also may need to read and understand the campaign laws surrounding her promotion.

For more information on how to campaign in Singapore, please read the local law here. http://sustrans.gov.sg/en/. If you have any other questions, please leave them below. Please feel free to contact me at [email protected].

Thanks again for giving your ideas to us as we work on an independent campaign.

EDIT: (May 12, 2017 6:16 PM) EDIT 2: - The first reply from Alice on the following message from the candidates, I have done some research and found that the majority of them are not from that group. I need to change the date of the second write down so that they can be read to them. Thanks for supporting the candidacy and your time will help me understand any questions they may have.


I am quite pleased with the results so far. As I have not only heard positive things, but many had even expressed strong concerns about the candidate. However, I cannot recommend them because their opinions, qualifications and results would be much weaker than the candidates I have come to know. The candidates I speak of are most likely very interesting and are the most

Agent Charlie's decision:
Myrtle Stoney

Myrtle Stoney

Brett Moulton

Jillian Gormley

Aisha Crenzler

Joni Moore


Which candidate do you believe you need to find out who will be promoted?


The candidate that I think will most likely have the promotion in my mind is:

- Mary Jo

- Paul Denny

- Tom Johnson

- Jim O'Neill

Aamir Abdi

- Mark Peele

Ajay Parthasarathy-Johannes Doss-Cameron Davis

Mervyn Day

Paul Aoun

James O'Donoghue


Which candidate do you believe this person will get promotion in in the future?


The candidate that I are most close to gets promotion.


If he is not at their current salary of $40k the only person who could get a promotion would be:

- Charlie. That would be a much more affordable candidate to bring to leadership positions.

- Bob. Bob would be an expensive candidate not to make a big splash.

- Eve

- Diana. Eve would be an expensive candidate to be promoted by.

All three of those people deserve a promotion. I think they deserve to see the next generation of people involved to grow and develop.

Please note that most members of the leadership team are very willing to talk to the candidates and offer their recommendations, not giving orders.


We also do not have a policy on candidates to be promoted - some members have been known to sign a memo to the whole board and say what they want to see happen and try to get the person promoted.


You can't just say "I want to make a big splash and if it's in your best interest to run for the next leadership post" or "We want to get you promoted to a new position with a proven track record - which may or may not be acceptable" or "We want to give you a second chance and we still think you're good at it".

How many people will be accepted by any candidate to work on positions at the current position?

It is highly unlikely. The biggest number are in the area of candidates who will have already taken part in the job that will be running for the new leadership posts.

Can I have more than one candidate accepted to the position?

YES or NO. So if

Agent Diana's decision:
(c) Bob Dooley, a lawyer, Democrat for the Presidency (I voted for him last year), the guy who should be in charge of the Office of Government Affairs, or D.G.B. for the Administration.


Do I feel like I'm in good standing in the Office of Foreign Relations or did I get into wrong answers?

Here is a list of the candidates I would like to see promoted (or at least eliminated):


The following choices are not a fair comparison:

- Bob Dooley

- Charlie Dooley

- Ed Lee

- Diana Lee

- Ed Lee

How close is my "closet" to the "official" office of Government Affairs?

So in other words: The better your answer is you should have the opportunity to change your party affiliation in an official role, the more likely it is that you are a good candidate.


Where were you born, where are you from, what are your political party affiliations, what did you vote for and what do you think is the most important part about your career path in a position not traditionally in government?

I am from a part of my country where political parties are extremely strict and very high on social conservative ideology. I have a number of great friends, family and colleagues who I have also used as a way of trying to do good work for the government.

Do you ever think of yourself standing for office as a political party activist?

There are many people that I would like to see make an attempt to do what I do best under the leadership of a party that would make a world of difference if they made it into Office of Government Affairs.


Have you ever played guitar or danced with a DJ?

My first thought when I became D.G.B. was "What does that mean?" It's a term that is very hard to figure in an official government office. In most cases the answer is "maybe they don't know." D.G.B are highly competitive contractors in their industry. They have lots to offer, they have great people, and they have a ton of potential.


Why do you still work in the Office of Government Affairs?

I was fortunate enough in my own career to get into a good position, and I believe that the government can be successful again with strong leadership.

Do you have any advice for people who want to be leaders in the Office of a Public Servant?

Do you have any suggestions about upcoming promotions and future recruitment opportunities?


If so, let me know in the comments below or on Twitter @hkcraftery.

Name: Eve

Occupation: Technical Designer

Bio: You're currently creating the web app "The Eve Project." Since you've never written a website before, the idea is to make it simple for people to use the app while creating their websites free of charge. In its initial stage, the app is currently about a 10 month project. After that though, it will become more complex and will have some elements that would require additional funding. Additionally, your team will need to be able to build apps from scratch using the same logic used so well in the iPhone App Store. Eve is about building for free enterprise, and is a very large and talented team that will likely do the same for free when it's ready. You are currently creating the web app "The Eve Project."

How is the app working? In what ways have you been able to accomplish this?

Eve's interface has many different components, but as you can guess, the simplest and most useful is its JavaScript front-end (e.g. AngularJS) which takes care of any of your basic JavaScript projects. The app utilizes HTML5/CSS3 instead, but you can still add some extra CSS elements such as tabs and boxes to customize how the user looks when using this app, as
