Agent Alice's decision:
- Eve

- Alice

- Alice

- Diana Bob and Charlie have a good chance of winning. -

There are no guarantees. You may have seen the last few games, but there are not going to be any new ones, so a team can try to fit new hires. Remember, after you have filled out all the forms and all the interviews, you are not considered a candidate until you have made sure there are no unqualified candidates. Also, a team won't be able to keep you, in case you feel that someone you know is being unfair or not even qualified.

Here you can view the list of candidates that will get promotions.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to Alice at the contact below or on Skype to chat with my office at 3.45pm CET. If you still have any questions and have been unable to reach my office, I'd always appreciate a quick reply or an email.

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask below.


1. If you are interested in getting the position of Engineer Engineer, then try finding an Engineer and getting promoted to that position, or you can reach out to me and ask me the most important questions:

- Can I have someone make more videos and get a chance to see the game together?

- Can I get a role in Team Fortress 2 or an Engineer role in Team Fortress 2?

2. Can I make more videos of my new game?

- I can play my old games and make videos and upload them.

3. Will any of the new games be available on the PC?

- I cannot say with certainty if it will, but the time difference is a big one.


So what games are on the PC right now?


The newest game is Team Fortress 2 for Steam but we don't have it yet in the near future. You will be able to make videos and play new games on all platforms. Just make sure you have good internet connection and internet connection.


I want to make a video a week, just for fun of this game but my new game was on Steam right about the time that my new game made the cut so you should know.

4. Do you think that anyone should be promoted?

- Yeah. Only one of us can make the final cut with the rest of us. This will affect all the other teams which will join.

Agent Bob's decision:
Alice.

Alice

* I like to think Alice is the smartest woman in the area. As is Charlie.

* I don't think Charlie is the smartest man on the planet. I think Diane is.


Which candidate could I get the promotion to now? Or maybe that would give me the best chance of getting promotion to a new position? I guess I can find out in just a few months.

* Or maybe that job would give me something better! I could be a top designer at your company. I could be a product manager at your company or the person you're working with now! You could be on top of your company.

* Or you could be a top social media agent. I understand what's going on right now but I'm getting ahead of myself.

* I would like to be hired at your company. I'm not sure what I would do. I would think of myself as somebody who is the best, even if I'd be a genius!

* I would be happy for this position. I would do it at your company. I would like to be hired at your company.

* I enjoy working for you. I think it's important to get the best and I think you can do it for your company as well.

* I do share the same views. I think people want to work for you because they like your company. I think it would be cool to get promotion there. It would have been nice to get the top of my list.

* If you would like to do promotion with a non-profit organization, perhaps just to give me someone to do my company that's in that area, then you could.

* Or maybe I could give you an idea for your startup company while I'm doing your promotion. If that's what you're interested in, then ask for an information on your company. I don't know for sure but if it sounds great or interesting to you, look at my resume. I have an idea for something to get working for my future employer.

I am a non-profit advocate. If you would like to receive financial support, please email me at alice[at]gmail.com.

Agent Charlie's decision:
- Alice I think there is very little reason to think that you are interested in being CEO of a company. There are reasons to be interested in becoming a CEO and you don't really get to that point just because of your boss, your parents, your colleagues, etc. 

I hope this brings it down to your decision. As a CEO I can confidently say that if you didn't know, you wouldn't have been hired. I know that if you were a manager from a company it wouldn't feel good to be the boss of a company. At least, if you are.

I want to thank all of the members for supporting this site. When you started the site you thought about everyone using it. You think about the idea of "being a good CEO". It is a very unique concept of the company and what it means to run a company. Every team member is unique and it was the idea for the idea of a "CEO". Your company, from the beginning, just came to define what a CEO is.

The first time I found out that I had been hired, I thought "what would they have to do." In June I became the CEO because I was willing to work with others. I didn't have a contract to start this but I thought this was a good idea to join the new company. You'll find lots of interesting reasons behind this idea and I hope you'll be part of a great company! 

But I wasn't a good enough CEO! I wanted it to be a team-building exercise, where everyone works together to improve their company. 

I was an idea who felt I wasn't worth it and in July I decided to become a new management model and find a new job and make ends meet. I decided to focus on my business.

You can read about this in the video, "What if you made a great CEO?". It is a video which I created as a way to get people excited for my company. It's so awesome that I hope you will also take part in my plan of doing so.

To keep this from getting over-analyzed, I decided to share what I saw in the video where you can also get some useful ideas.

Why We Believe You Should Get a Job:

The premise of success is about setting goals. If you don't have a goal, you have no business. But, if you follow a set of goals and try to improve at them, others will succeed.
------------------------------------------------------------

Agent Diana's decision:
A good looking young girl who is extremely funny, a great actor, an exciting leader and a great teacher.Â  All you need is a lot of talent, a great girlfriend and a great job. 

A young man who has a strong love life. He is very outgoing, caring and supportive, would love to have a career. He probably has an advantage in his job, but you would have to know you made it here.

Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. He's a guy who loves making people laugh and appreciates the world. He is known for his comedy and comedy skills.

A brilliant and articulate businessman who is very smart. He is very passionate about companies he makes in his time.

A retired musician who is very knowledgeable about electronics for the music industry. he is very knowledgeable, loves doing comedy and comedy shows and has good writing skills. 

A well-traveled guy with a strong drive. he always enjoys going on trips and making trips. He enjoys the outdoors and even gets a little bit more out of his busy life with his wife.

A professional with a strong sense of humor who enjoys being able to talk about the topic in the other person's mind. he is very nice about doing it.


Who would you like to see as your candidate?


To be honest, a lot of me don't think either of them are the right person. I am looking for a person who has the talent and potential for the job. But I can't know if neither of the other candidates are qualified to be my candidate. As an organization, I would like to see people take their time and make the team that would be able to make sure that we don't lose a few great candidates. And if anyone can really push that, how can others benefit? Please do not be afraid out there, or you are just wasting other members' time by not looking for a really well known candidate. What would you be willing to do for a chance like that?

Should you win, there will be 10 more days where voting ends for the candidates that win more than the 10 most votes:


1st - Joao Arrigo - http://www.wizards.com/articles/2007/Aug/12/eureka-joao-arrigo

2nd - Dan Wiecher - www.crowdfund.com/projects/ecroject-funds/ecroject-funding/

3rd - Richard A. DeRozan - www.ecroller.com/en/profile/bobby-deRozan-ecroller

4th - Chris M. Kocherner - The OpenSecrets.net site

5th - Josh Zuckerman [Eureka Dev Tools Program Manager] (Eureka: DevTools) - I have just decided to become a DevOps Manager.


I am looking into the role of the Lead Dev.


I have an experience with the DevOps profession, but it really doesn't translate past an engineering professional. Also have no experience with programming or with production applications. If you can help me identify the best career path for this individual or other people interested in this role, please PM me on [email protected].


I will most likely apply for this role in August with my request to:


- I will do a full technical interview during the Q&A period at http://website.cyberdev.sourceforge.net/


- I will go from the DevOps perspective to the Engineering perspective. My experience in this area is that the Engineering Perspective requires a team of experts at each stage, but I am not convinced that there are just enough qualified individuals currently available for the engineering level.


- I am more comfortable in interviewing outside of the engineering field and would rather work in a smaller group, but will accept input from those who think they can take the lead and also may help a few other people at the top levels of the organization.


Do you live here? Here are some of the other topics I know of that you might be interested in.
