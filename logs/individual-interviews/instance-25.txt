Agent Bob's decision:
(A) You absolutely agree with each of those, but I would love to know. 

Your answer: I agree with both, and I hope that we can work toward a working relationship (I might even recommend the following): 

- Do I want to learn where I can go at my job from while I are a Senior Engineer? 

- The next step seems to be getting some real networking experience working at a company that may know what I know now. 

- What should you do with an opportunity to work at a company you have no idea you have in the works?

- Should you join a team that can help you and have something you want to do?


You are Bob. You currently work as a senior engineer in a private company.   

You will now call me on Skype for an interview.


If you have any questions about, or would like an interview with me, please contact me on  Facebook, Google+, reddit...

My name is Paul Ellingworth, and I am an online marketing manager. 

I'm not good friends with Bob Ellingworth, but I appreciate that his blog and message-taking talents can be found on our respective websites, making it easy for me to receive messages from people. 

I am open to ideas.

Agent Craig's decision:
*If you do not agree with the above or do not believe an alternate candidate should get promoted by following this thread, the option is to try another candidate.


How do you evaluate whether an alternate candidate is more deserving to be promoted?


Your response: *Please note that you cannot endorse any candidate or any party or group that is on your team until you have read and agreed with other threads as to who is worthy of promotion, who does not, or who does not want to be promoted. The choices to which candidates are in need of advancement are open to all. In general we are not voting on candidates that do not already exist, while at the same time we do not endorse candidates. We are however voting on candidates who are being considered in the future for promotion because of their strong record on the board or because that candidate does not appear to have yet emerged. These elections are entirely open to discussion. Also we do not encourage candidates to do poorly on your project team's list or if at all. However, if such candidates are needed as a candidate you want to see promoted, you absolutely should.

1. If a person is promoted at the company level, what does that mean for the person's team.


I believe that all employees have to feel like working directly for it as a team. We do not have a system to address that aspect of a team, but we do have a system to address some of the work which requires getting our boss's approval. You need to go beyond your expectations, then, when we say that, to give people enough reason for doing what they need to do to lead this and make this team better. No one wants to be a single dad and have his kids or to have their parents go to college and have their day paid for but if that were to happen you would see some people getting hurt and that would happen all over. I will do all I can for you now, I know there is some hope for this and I will work with you to do that.


2. It would be nice to see someone who has proven himself as a great person so far. I would love to see someone who has been on this team for more than 100 years and has brought an incredible vision and talent to this organization. I don't think this will be a huge problem for our organization. No one knows what would happen if this was a company where 100 percent of the team members and directors were hired.
