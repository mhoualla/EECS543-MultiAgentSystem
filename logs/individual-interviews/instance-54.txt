Agent Alice's decision:
: 

- Alice


As you can see, I disagree.

My personal suggestion is: 

1. Do something to convince Bob that he's a "lovable" person, and don't give up on him.

2. Give up on Bob, and move on to some other better guy.

3. Make sure you still have room for Bob to have a career.


This is my personal opinion (and yes I accept it. But you gotta be a good guy to work off the above guidelines!).

Do some experiments! I do a lot of experiments, and I've come up with all sorts of different suggestions for what should happen in a promotion. So check out each of the following, as I have tried to write my own advice over the years. If you know ideas of how I've implemented others, please let me know. I'm pretty sure I've put you with a lot of good ideas!

1. Give up on Alice. And make no mistake:

- You should not start a promotion if you don't know what Bob is doing with his life

- You should never start your promotion if you think the person you love is "the problem" and "the solution".

- It's a good idea to give up early on (after all it was the same person who told you this), and give it early too.

2. Start a promotion with a friend.

3. Give up in order to save your life, but try to help Bob.

4. Give up, and save up your life.

5. You're not the person that you said you were.

6. You're the person that you thought would be the "big problem" of your life.

6. Get out of your life.


If I start to think of a future where you know what is going to happen to your life because you've never thought about it, I might be left with a dilemma.

What if suddenly I think about "I got a job".

What if suddenly, I think of what will happen to your life when you finally become a competent person?


Well here's how an example works from now on. When you first get an offer from a job at a startup, go look at how many people there are at your location on the local network:

(The following is a total of 12 candidates.


Please give your preference as of June 13, 2018.)


Who's the most interesting and interesting, the most unique and surprising candidate? Do you like them all? Have you been involved/acquainted with any of the other candidate(s)?

Thank you for your time you've put towards this process. We will respond to your submission on June 23rd. We love to hear your feedback! -----

P.S. There's an old "why do I get promoted when I get killed off" article that I wrote about last year called for you to be promoted out of the top 10 applicants after taking into consideration the competition level of applicants (as it was for me as a Senior Engineer). It also notes that the top 3% of applicants, with the exceptions (which are you with your computer or your phone, i.e. the people that you work with on every program) are the same people that you're in the competition, so I'd like to send you the link to this article for anyone that wants to have an honest look at how your candidate situation has been handled so far. You may feel a bit biased if you don't see this. The original post can be found below. It's written by Bill O'Connell and not by any of those who were involved with the process of writing this blog post. ----- Thanks for reading. I'm glad to hear that you have put your time into this and would take this opportunity to share what you went through so far. But I think I'll be a bit of a spoiler when writing this post, because I know some people may be thinking that I should focus on the top 5, because I'm going to focus more on their background to give you an idea of how far they have come. I would say this: I'd highly recommend you study the above paragraphs to get a feel for the people involved. They all share a similar background, but they all share skills, interests, talents, and interests within a similar skill set. It's amazing how much time has gone into getting people to share what they have. At their core, they share their experiences with being a Lead Engineer with a job, working an internship with a company, working off the side to make sure they are getting in on the right team.

Agent Charlie's decision:
Bob


Bob


I just saw Alice in action here, having been the Lead Engineer at LMC for so ten years. I think she has a good personality.


Bob


Do you think she should be given a promotion to the position, given that she is probably on her own?


I just met her at 5pm, and I do think she should get a promotion. But I don't know if she should be given a promotion because she is a woman. 

Charlie


I've received countless feedback online over the years about that girl (in fact, I haven't heard of her until now). My idea is she should find a suitable position and go through with her decision. 

As far as I can tell, even though it doesn't happen very often outside of China, she did her best to convince me that she can get the job done at my own cost and that she should work very hard to get in. 

I would like to see LMC move forward with a career that would lead to a good working record and make the most of her opportunity to stay back in China.

Do you know more about LMC? Do you have questions/comments?

And finally, I wouldn't ask for a raise, I'd ask for a raise for myself.... so if someone wants to hear from me then send me a PM or leave a tweet using Facebook for messages.

Agent Diana's decision:
- Alice

- Charlie

- Diana

- Eve


For this position, let's choose the following:

- Alice (20)

- Charlie (14)


Then, let's choose the rest of the job! You will earn $1250.10 during the 1st 2 weeks of the year, depending on the year of hiring:


- Alice

- Charlie

- Diana

- Eve


Then, let's choose the following positions every two to three months after you hire Alice, when she's still available for one more month of training. That's why, to the end of this 2nd 2 month, you will earn $1350.10/month:


- Alice

- Charlie

- Diana

- Eve


All the above positions are free, but you and the company won't have to pay your wages - by adding $10/month to the total you can earn up to $3300!


What is your salary for the day job?

Your salary for the day job is 10.4%. Based from your earnings, your earnings will equal (at the end of the 2nd 2 month) $9,100. You can't count on our services to find out how and where it gets paid.

You also must have a contract that covers 20% or more of your total hourly rate for the last 13 months at 6% of your salary. That means you will be required to submit the following annual reports; all along the way:

Credit/Credit Cards, 401(k) plans, retirement pay (in a total of between 50-75% of your weekly salary)

Total Net Assets (if your total was less. Include assets or liabilities from your employee pension plan and all other liabilities from your employer retirement plan

Equipment or personal items used in your job)

Paying of payroll due date, and your estimated monthly pay at the end of the 3-month period after your 4th salary. Pay for those monthly accounts immediately prior to the pay. Pay for

Agent Eve's decision:
Â Alice

Â Bob

Â Diana

Â Eve


This is the third promotion I want to pursue for Eve. 

Here is the same post that wrote about my recommendation of the promotion:


How can I get the promotion with the current salary for the position?

Yes, one of the two ways, at least to me (I would personally say you should start working at 12 atleast for now), is to hire and then hire out in mid-2014, to start out in the long run, with my current salary. 

So, the main choice for now is, to find someone to work for you or with whom to work for you that also wants to work with you, or to offer you the job you want. 

Also, there are probably at least 50 of us or in some case closer to more than 50-60 employees with many years of experience in the global internet business or technical industries (like you) that you feel I have too strong a case against.  

How can I be more involved?

I actually believe that many of You probably did very well in last year's election.
