Agent Alice's decision:
[...]

If they both got promotion, which candidate would you like to hear in the second election?


Your response:

No, I can't. The first election would have been more important for Alice and Bob. The second election would be one of life.


Your response:

No, I'm not in. It's not that I am, but I don't think I can. That sounds like a choice you would give to someone of a different skill set. 


Your response:

No, I'm not in. It's not that I am, but I don't think I can. If they both got promotion, I would want that opportunity and not that. (...)


Your response:

[...]

Not that I want the promotion. My name is Jack, I'm a freelance writer, and I'm starting the project today, so I might as well let's just go with the first choice. (...)


What is this contest that you are about to enter. (Please contact me to ask questions.)


Your response:

[...]

You are a professional. I am looking for your skill level and experience... my name is Jack, and I'm the first candidate for the title of Lead Designer at ATSW. (...) You could also be your first choice for the second job or even for the position of a top management officer at ATSW. 

Your response:

[...]

It isn't up to this job. It's up to me.


Your response:

[...]

You don't know what you're doing. You don't know what to do. I'm trying to make something happen. (...)


Your response:

[...]

You're still not there yet. You know where you're at. How long can I stay here? (...)


Your response:

[...]

I don't know how long you're here either. It could be a few weeks. I don't know what a long internship would do. (...)


Your response:

[...]

I don't know if you're still here, and if you've been in contact with me since the day you said you would make all kinds of changes to your development of your game. There might even be a job for you at the Department of Engineering. I won't make any changes. (...)

Agent Bob's decision:
Alice, you're on a little high. You're definitely on the path to promotion.

Charlie, you're absolutely not. You're always going to be at the bottom. The only reason you decided to start working at Pixar after graduating from college is because you have never met another teacher, not because you had never actually looked at one as you did.

Agent Charlie's decision:
Thank you and I am now convinced you should decide as your candidate.

* (If you have any questions about this section, please send an email to joi.mallard@nfl.org to ask them.)

Your response:

Thank you.


Please note that you are free to do any of the following: 

- work in software for money, hire people at your company, work as an employee of the company (as explained above), or

- attend seminars and lectures to find out more about your training & knowledge. As with any promotion, there are a few things that should be stated to you: 

2 - choose your own job (I know I can do all I want except the "best job you can do" or "the easiest job that I can possibly do")

- hire (or ask for "free") any staff it may need, provide you with professional training, contact information and/or pay at your company if so desired.

- hire to provide you with a job within 10 working days of taking the decision.

* If you want to work with your coworkers, but don't consider being a freelancer, I would leave you to decide where to go: http://www.gofundme.com, please tell me a topic so I can give you more information about your situation at my company to share with everybody on the site. It's the best way of getting paid. If I get stuck with only working on projects you want to support, you can also try on a new project that you've found a way to get involved with before you start with work in your company.

3 - decide the position!

You are currently considered, but it's an important decision to make. (For those of you who don't know how we do this, if you're interested in my job at my company, click here.)

You may decide to stay or go if this is your dream job, but there are a few factors you need to consider when choosing when: **If I am applying for this job, I want to find my boss with great experience as a programmer and so I know this is what should be done for me! (This is part of my job and I should not put it off or let my boss decide who I should work for...) This should also give me a shot at joining our team, I can tell you about their training before I have even gotten to their facility so I know where they trained,

Agent Diana's decision:
Eve

Alice

Bob

Charlie

And the fact that that candidate is also a Computer Engineer that you are working for a salary of $5300.

Your reply: 

Diana

Charlie

And who are you hoping to reach out to the next one and not get hired? 

Your response: 

Diana

Alice

Charlie

You already stated that she is working on an investment in the business (if it works). 

The fact that she is listed in the end quote would help you get her promoted as the Engineer. 

Your response: 

You have stated several times as you have made an effort to get Eve to switch companies, but it seems that you haven't come out with any information on her and that other people in the company have already left that she is working on investment projects with. And I know you would like all of the company to take action if someone came out with any information about Eve regarding how she is working.


Your response: 

You were contacted by someone (or at least some one) that has expressed interest in you. 

I'm also aware that if we could get Eve to switch companies then, we would not want to sell her. 

Your response: 

You did, but she does appear to be working on an investment venture. 

She is listed as a Software Engineer. 

I can see how a person like that may seem very appealing to some people, even if they do not take the plunge, because if those people were doing it it was for the right reasons.

Your response:

It seems that we do not want to sell the employee for nothing. We have a really good plan to keep people coming out if there is enough interest.

You have stated that that is not something that could or would happen, which of course is true, but that would mean that no employee would really be willing to work on this particular business. 

Your response: 

You also stated that it doesn't seem like she has any immediate plan to start one. If she did, it looks as if the rest of the job wouldn't get any harder, because there would still be enough interest.

That is, we'd have no reason to sell any of Eve's employees.

Your response

Thank you very much, Eve.


Congratulations. Thank you.

I look

Agent Eve's decision:
you would like to be promoted to Lead Engineer, as it is an option.


Any questions, comments, suggestions and questions for us?


Thanks!

Sleeping Giant

Lead Writer Hello. How's your day going, Eve?


Hey, I'm sleeping. You're really happy, don't you? But why are you sleeping in the cabin?


Thanks, that looks very strange.


Hey, you were playing Call of Duty, right? Aren't you tired of the job?


Yeah, and like so many other people you know, it is annoying. I don't mind any of that. That's why I'm really glad that you called home last night.


Okay.


You have a lot of questions about me, what do I do?


You have been saying your day is being busy right now, right? How do you do that? Do you make time for a work project on my dime?


I'm working on this game for $400 and it is a huge project. I can't help but think why do you have to work so hard and put yourself in it for so much money in order to get a job?


So you say you're always busy, right?


Of course it is. At work, you put your whole life on hold and you do so much that you don't enjoy yourself. You put your whole life on hold for so many hours just to get a job. That's exhausting.


So how do you work?


I always enjoy giving my time to my friends. So there you go. But I want to share this with you. If you want to know how good that is, I know you want to answer that.


Oh, well. There really is no time to waste.


That's a funny story. I'm not here to tell you about the hours I put in to figure out if there's any truth to your life story. I only want to do this so you can find them the time you need. It's what you will be doing all day while being lazy.


Okay, ok. Okay, you can go off to bed now.


Okay? What's up?


So. Well, I'd never even met your wife. You are a very nice person. Very pretty and very kind to you. But you can't be so quick when you need to and you don't go out for those things.


You've really helped my
