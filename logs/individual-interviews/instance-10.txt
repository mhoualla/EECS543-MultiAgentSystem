Alice's parents and I are really proud of her, as I did well at school and we were at an excellent start in life.

Her attitude and competence is outstanding

Your response:

I would like to join a team working out of their comfort zone. While many of your coworkers work around the company, my team is not a team working out of their comfort zone.

This person is a wonderful person and has a great personality. He has developed himself, helped his parents, worked with my family and is working very hard. He is very intelligent and hard-working. Thank you for having him as your Team Leader.

Agent Charlie's decision:
"You are Charlie... If you can't believe how good of a company Alice is, ask her - she is one of this year's Best Employees. She is the only one of the fifteen employees I would like to hire. Ask her, she has a good attitude."

When discussing salary, I often ask my employees to select a number. Alice will also respond with an explanation and the quote "You know what? No one likes to pay you more than the lowest paid person in work right now."

You also need to add an additional information point to your reply. If all the questions about how to increase your salary have already been answered, the list and other relevant information is up to you.

As for how to earn your salary - you must choose a "Pay as you Earn" contract in the job search. The salary you get depends on how much you work and the number of hours you work.

Agent Diana's decision:
If you find these applicants to be "out of control" and have a lack of character, if you want to see further development of yourself as a leader and a person you can be in control of, then your best bet is to hire an experienced and very knowledgeable individual.
