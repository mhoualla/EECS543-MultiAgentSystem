Agent Charlie's decision:
- Alice


Diane


Bubble Bob


Bob Dobles

Erika

(I don't know if this is a good choice at all. My feeling is she has already stated she will not seek promotion as she is considered too unstable to be promoted. )


As you know the position at the right time is an extremely difficult one: (you will work at one of the following organisations and will have to work through many changes in order to get promoted: http://paypal.co.uk/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=1&authkey=wzM0A5J5QYKKXqbT6TZ8RJ7sDV6gNdVQ5zS_8bxhHJQA

How did this happen? You mentioned it here first before and we're now here trying to verify and understand what happened.

It seems like you are looking at things from the perspective that as a technical advisor, there has been a "good enough job" that you have no desire to resign.


I do not have any experience in the role. If you are interested in becoming the next Chief Engineer of an organisation or business, I would suggest you consider becoming a CIO first. As with any position, it is best to ask for the best possible technical advice and that is the only way I can suggest these candidates for promotion.


Also please note you should use the link with the position description to help you further understand them better. I would only recommend asking in that sense, or perhaps for the sake of your time or experience, please be prepared to help out someone when you get involved in an exciting opportunity.

- If your company has a business on the short list, you will get a job. - If not, your company cannot be in this list.

(you can then join on the current list of candidates

Agent Eve's decision:
John A. Johnson

Dawn A. Smith & Sons --


1. Alice

(5) Bob


2. Diane


3. James C. Davis


4. James J. Watson


5. Eve


6. Charles S. Clark


7. John B. Fagan

--(1) Eve Johnson is the newest candidate for promotion, which is about 7 years old. 

1. Alice is a female of the same class as Alice, but she is only a year older than the other three candidates. 

2. Alice has a large brain, so she has been through almost seven hours of high school. 

The other candidates also seem very interesting. ---------------------------- 1. Alice has a big brain. 

1. Alice has a big brain. 2. In the past ten years she had the experience of teaching in a high school.

She could not get a job in a college where she is employed.  

3. Since high school in 2010 Alice has earned a grade point of 50 points.


Who has your experience with promotion and what does it take to advance one of these candidates to promotion? -------- -- You should use your best judgment and evaluate the available options. You will probably want to make certain that you know you're up to speed with all the information needed for advancing. --------------------- 3. Alice is a female. ---------------

4. Alice's father is from South Carolina. He is the daughter of a government employee and a retired cop officer. 

5. Alice's father is from Virginia Beach. When Alice was a teenager, his mother was the daughter of a government employee. Her husband worked for the Department of Justice but lost the job when Alice was 17. 

6. Although her mother is disabled, Alice lives with her aunt in Georgia at the county school she attended. 

7. Alice is a middle school teacher in a town on the far west coast of Virginia.  If she did not pursue a career, then Alice will probably be at a disadvantage from the beginning. --------------------- 8. Alice's father is a retired cop officer who has been on active duty since 2004. After being appointed by the court, he retired from the police force at the end of 2017. When he was arrested for having firearms possession, he said he "miscalculated" his income and should be able to pay for another car he borrowed. On his record
